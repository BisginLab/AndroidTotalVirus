# VirusTotal Submission Script

## Overview
This script reads MD5 hashes from a CSV file and submits them to the VirusTotal API to fetch analysis reports. The reports are saved in both CSV and JSON formats for further analysis.

### Key Features:
- Reads MD5 hashes from a CSV (`md5_hashes.csv`).
- Submits each hash to VirusTotal and fetches the analysis report.
- Saves the JSON report in a folder structure based on the APK file's original location.
- Writes summary statistics to a CSV (`virustotal_results.csv`).

### Key Files:
- **Input File**: `md5_hashes.csv` (contains MD5 hashes and APK filenames)
- **Output Files**:
  - `virustotal_results.csv`: Summary statistics of the VirusTotal scan.
  - JSON reports for each hash stored in `/home/umflint.edu/hrychen/Android-Data/json_reports/`.

### Usage:
1. Make sure your `md5_hashes.csv` file is populated.
2. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python submit_to_virustotal_report.py
